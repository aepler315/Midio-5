// The linter this repo went without until a duplicate method name cost it a
// whole visual effect.
//
// BiomeManager defined `_drawMirage` twice. A class body keeps only the last
// definition, so the ocean fata morgana added by #185 was unreachable from
// the day it merged and drew zero pixels for a week -- with all 2305 tests
// green, because the tests covering its math were right and the math was
// simply never called. `no-dupe-class-members` is in eslint:recommended and
// catches it in milliseconds. So does `no-unused-private-class-members` for
// the `_mirageRecipe` field orphaned alongside it.
//
// ABOUT THE BASELINE. Turning a linter on over 55k lines of code written
// without one surfaces 129 pre-existing findings, none of them urgent and
// none of them what this config is here for. Rewriting all 129 in the same
// change as the fix would bury it and risk regressions in files nobody was
// auditing. So every rule is a real error, and the existing findings are
// recorded in eslint-suppressions.json instead: new violations fail, old
// ones are visible and countable, and `--prune-suppressions` shrinks the
// file as they get paid off. It is a debt ledger, not a set of rules turned
// off.
