# Sync: setting the Bluetooth delay by tapping

**Sync** (the HUD button, or `C`) runs a two-part tap pass over the playing
song. Nothing stops, nothing is hidden: the music keeps going, the world
keeps moving, and the overlay takes no pointer input at all — taps fall
straight through to the canvas, which is what feeds both the beat anchor and
this measurement.

1. **Tap the kick, when you hear it.** Go by your ears.
2. **Tap when the ring flashes.** Go by your eyes.

The delay is the difference between the two, and it updates after every tap.

## Why two passes and not one

A tap made by ear says when the **sound** reached the ear. A tap made by eye
says when the **picture** reached the eye. Neither alone is the A/V skew.

A by-ear pass is blind to display latency entirely — which is how a
projected or re-encoded screen can be badly out of step while the pass keeps
reporting that everything is fine. That was the original failure: the only
correction it could ever propose was on the audio side, so a lagging
*picture* was invisible to it.

Setting the two arrivals equal:

```
sound at the ear   = kick + hardwareDelay + audioDelay
picture at the eye = kick + visualLag     + displayDelay
```

gives `trim = (hardwareDelay − reportedLatency) − displayDelay`, which is
exactly `median(ear) − median(eye)` once each side is normalised for the
trim in force when it was measured.

**The player's own bias cancels.** Everyone anticipates a beat by some
amount, and nobody's amount is the same. That habit appears in *both* passes
and drops out of the subtraction — so the answer is the machine's latency
rather than a mixture of the machine and the person. That is the real reason
to run two, and a single pass has no equivalent protection: there the habit
lands straight in the number.

## What the ring is, and why it is on that clock

The eye phase's target is drawn from the chart's kicks on the **visual
clock** — the same clock, with the same lag applied, that the characters'
beat-anchored moves are drawn on. Tapping it therefore measures the path
from "the app decided to draw this beat" to "a person saw it".

A marker running on its own private timer would measure nothing: it would be
a stopwatch racing itself. This is also why the ear phase's big block count
is hidden during the eye phase — two things pulsing at once gives the eye a
choice, and the measurement wants one target in one fixed place. The ring
sits high and centred over sky for the same reason: a timing target has to
be in the same place every beat, and the middle of the stage is where the
characters are.

## Why raw offsets cannot be pooled

A tap is stamped on the clock the ear is on (`visualNow`), which already has
the current trim subtracted. So an offset measured under a trim of *T* is
the **residual** against *T*, not the absolute error. Once the trim moves
after every tap — the point of the feature — successive offsets are each
measured against a different trim, and pooling them converges on the wrong
number.

Ear taps are therefore stored as what each implies the trim *should* be
(`trimInForce + offset`), which cancels the trim in force at the time. Eye
taps are stored raw, because what they measure — how long the picture takes
to arrive — does not move when the trim does. Both use a trimmed median over
the last 16, so one stray tap cannot drag the delay.

Both signs work through the same arithmetic even though a positive trim
delays the **visuals** and a negative one delays the **audio**: the algebra
cancels either way, and a pass can cross zero mid-way without a discontinuity.

## Tap the kick

The instruction names what the pass actually measures. Taps are matched
against the chart's **kicks** (`RHYTHM` events flagged `kick`), so the
overlay's older wording — "the kick, the snare, wherever your hand wants to
go", which is right for teaching `BeatAnchor` a groove — sent a
snare-tapper's taps into the gaps between kicks, where they are discarded
and the delay never moves.

For the same reason a tap explicitly marked as the high part (`J`, or a
right-click) is left out of the measurement. It still reaches the beat
anchor, which wants both hands.

Measuring against *all* percussion was the other option, and it is worse:
kicks and snares together put onsets every half beat, which halves the range
of latency a tap can unambiguously express — and 100–200ms is exactly the
range this exists to find.

## Limits worth knowing

- **The trim cannot run away.** A positive trim is added to the lag
  `visualNow` clamps at `MAX_LATENCY_MS` (350ms), while the stored
  preference rails at ±500ms. Past the clamp the number rises and the
  picture does not, so a loop measuring its own residual would never close
  the error. The calibrator takes the ceiling that will actually take effect
  and says when it has reached it. Raise `MAX_LATENCY_MS` if a real setup
  needs more; the constant's own comment says so.
- **Onset lists are not a grid.** A real one ran `1010, 81, 917, 81` — the
  kicks arrive in flammed pairs. Clusters collapse to their first onset
  before matching, because a player taps where the cluster *starts*. The
  threshold is a fraction of the beat, not a fixed number of milliseconds:
  a 100ms double-kick is real music, and double-kick figures live in fast
  music, so a beat-relative threshold separates the ornament from the
  pattern.
- **One pass cannot discover an error larger than half a beat**, since past
  that the tap is nearer the next kick. At 120bpm that is 250ms.
- **A tap with no kick within that window is not a measurement.** Feeding it
  in as a zero would drag the estimate toward "no correction needed" — the
  one answer it cannot have earned. The last good reading stands.
- **A trim typed in by hand wins.** The chip stays reachable during a pass;
  a manual edit resets the calibrator to that value rather than being folded
  into it, because taps collected under the old trim are not evidence about
  the new one.

## The HUD

Both button clusters fade on the same timer, and both are held open while a
Sync pass or a recording is running — the control that ends either one lives
in there, and a faded HUD sits under the canvas where its wake-up tap is
deliberately absorbed.

## Testing

* `test/syncCalibrator.test.js` — the matching and the flam collapse, the
  closed loop under a moving trim, the two-phase arithmetic, the bias
  cancelling across five different player habits, the ceiling and the
  runaway it prevents, the marker pulse, session gaps, and the readout's
  wording.
* A browser pass drove both halves end to end against a simulated player
  whose screen ran 130ms behind: the trim reached a negative value — which a
  by-ear pass can never produce — the audio delay node followed it, the song
  kept playing and the world stayed drawn throughout.
