// The world contract, enforced.

// BiomeManager is 7,000 lines, 256 fields and 100 methods. Its seven world
// draw modules use 40 of those members. Before WorldRegistry.js there was
// nothing written down that said which 40, so the honest answer to "may a
// world read this?" was "read the other worlds and guess" -- and every field
// added to the manager silently widened the surface a world could couple to.
//
// These tests are what makes WORLD_CONTRACT a contract rather than a comment.
// They read the module sources rather than executing them, because the thing
// under test is the shape of the coupling, and a draw call needs a canvas, a
// palette pair and a populated manager to run at all.
