// Two structural mistakes a class body can make in total silence.
//
// A class body keeps only the LAST definition of a method name. Define the
// same name twice and the earlier one is not an error, not a warning, and
// not reachable -- it is simply gone, along with every call that meant to
// reach it. BiomeManager carried two `_drawMirage` methods for a week: the
// ocean fata morgana added by #185 and the older DUNE ground mirage. The
// ground one won, so the call meant for the fata morgana ran the wrong body
// with a biome profile where a y-coordinate belonged. Every argument past
// the fourth was dropped, `canvas.height - profile` was NaN, and the whole
// effect drew exactly zero pixels for its entire life. All 2305 tests
// passed the whole time, including the ones covering FataMorgana.js's math,
// because the math was never wrong -- it was never called.
//
// The second mistake is the same failure seen from the call site: passing
// more arguments than a method declares. JS drops the surplus silently, so
// a signature that drifts away from its callers reports nothing.
//
// Both are cheap to check from source and neither is checkable any other
// way -- once the module is evaluated the duplicate has already collapsed
// and the surplus arguments are already gone.
