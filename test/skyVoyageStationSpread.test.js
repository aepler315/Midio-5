// Midasus's voyages have to spread across the sky over a song, not pile up.
//
// _navTarget returns the centroid of the densest clump of her own atlas
// stars, and trigger() used to lerp EVERY station toward it at NAV_PULL
// (0.65). The input of that pull is its own output: a voyage dragged to the
// clump deposits three more figures there, so the next _navTarget finds the
// same clump denser and pulls harder. Nothing ever sent her to empty sky.
//
// The result on screen was a single dense knot of stars in one corner --
// whichever corner the FIRST voyage rolled -- and a bare sky everywhere
// else, in every world (drawDeepSky is called from _drawSky, which every
// world kind runs). It only showed up minutes into a song, which is why it
// survived a 32-second smoke fixture where the atlas is still empty.
