// What this replaces: the schedule builder in BiomeManager._buildSchedule
// measured novelty as the Euclidean distance between a 4-point trailing mean
// of seven band energies and the same mean four points earlier, and labelled
// the resulting sections by greedily clustering that same 7-band shape
// (SongForm.analyzeSongForm). Band energy is a timbre proxy and nothing else,
// so a verse and a chorus sharing an arrangement were indistinguishable, and
// nothing in the pipeline ever looked at harmony at all.
//
// What this does instead is the textbook pair:
//   * boundaries  -- Foote novelty: correlate a checkerboard kernel down the
//     diagonal of a self-similarity matrix. It answers "does the music before
//     this instant resemble itself, does the music after resemble itself, and
//     do the two halves resemble each other?", which is what a section
//     boundary actually IS. A trailing-mean difference can only see a jump in
//     level.
//   * labels -- a time-lag matrix: a chorus is not "material with a similar
//     average spectrum", it is "material that literally recurs". Scoring
//     diagonals of the SSM finds the repeats directly.
//
// The features are chroma (pitch class, transposition-aware harmony) fused
// with the seven band energies (timbre). Chroma is weighted higher because
// harmony is what separates sections that share a texture.
//
// Costs nothing extra to run: PitchTracker.computePitchFeatures already runs
// the FFT over the whole song for melody/bass tracking, and its per-frame
// semitone energies fold straight into chroma. Pure and DOM-free -- it takes
// plain arrays, so it is directly testable.

// scaled by sqrt(w) each land at unit-norm-times-sqrt(w), the resulting
