//
// Analysing a whole song before the world picker appears takes time in
// proportion to its length -- about 3.8s for five minutes on a fast desktop,
// more on a phone. So a song long enough to matter is analysed in two passes:
// its first OPENING_SECONDS, which is enough to recommend a world and start
// playing in well under a second, and then the whole song, in the
// background. When the whole-song analysis lands, the song's data is
// upgraded in place (adoptFullAnalysis) and a song already playing is
// rebuilt at the moment it has reached, with the music left running.
//
// A song's LOOK -- its seed, the profile its world is tailored and its
// ranges matched from, its custom biome -- comes from the opening pass and
// stays put. Swapping it at the upgrade would repaint the world mid-song,
// and deriving it from the whole song on a later play would make a song look
// different the second time. So it is kept as `songIdentity` and cached with
// the analysis (AnalysisBundle), and every later play reuses it.
