// Naming a recording by what it sounds like.
//
// The engine's expensive knowledge about a song -- band energies across the
// whole timeline, the bar grid, the structural boundaries, the note timeline
// -- takes tens of seconds to compute and is identical every time the same
// recording is analysed. To reuse it, or one day to serve it from a database
// while the listener's own app plays the audio, the analysis needs a KEY: a
// short, stable name for "this recording", derivable from the audio alone.
//
// A file hash cannot be that key. The same master as mp3 and as flac is the
// same performance and must get the same show, and their bytes share nothing.
// Nor can artist/title metadata: it is missing, misspelled, or attached to a
// remaster with different timings, and it cannot be checked against the sound
// at all.
//
// So this is an acoustic fingerprint, in the Haitsma-Kalker form: for each
// short frame, one bit per band saying whether that band's energy rose
// relative to its neighbour, compared against the previous frame. Two
// properties make it the right tool:
//
//   IT SURVIVES ENCODING. Every bit is a SIGN of a DIFFERENCE of a
//   DIFFERENCE. Lossy compression, EQ, a volume change and a different
//   sample rate all move absolute energies; they rarely flip the sign of a
//   local slope. Absolute-energy fingerprints do not survive any of that.
//
//   IT ALIGNS. The frames form a sequence, so two recordings are compared by
//   sliding one against the other and taking the lowest bit error rate. The
//   offset that wins is not just evidence of a match -- it is HOW FAR INTO
//   THE SONG the other recording is. The same routine that answers "is this
//   the same song?" answers "and what time is it?", which is exactly what
//   syncing a stored analysis to audio playing in the room requires.
//
// The band range is deliberately narrow (300-2000 Hz). That is where most
// music has energy and where perceptual codecs preserve the most detail;
// including the sub-bass and the top octave would add bits that MP3 and a
// phone speaker both destroy.
//
// One property worth knowing before trusting a reading: A BAND WITH NO
// SIGNAL IN IT PRODUCES A MEANINGLESS BIT. The sign of a difference between
// two empty bands is decided by numerical residue, so it is effectively a
// coin flip that any perturbation re-flips. Over music this does not matter
// -- the range is chosen precisely because music occupies it -- but it means
// near-silence, a lone sine tone, or a heavily band-limited source will
// report a high bit error rate against themselves under any noise at all.
// Treat a match verdict over near-silent audio as no verdict.
import { fft } from './PitchTracker.js';

// Everything below happens at a reduced rate, and that single decision is
// what makes the fingerprint both fast and alignable.
//
// The bits only describe 300-2000 Hz, so a rate of 8k is already generous
// (Nyquist 4k). Resampling first shrinks every FFT by more than five times,
// and the saving is spent on OVERLAP -- which is what alignment actually
// needs. Two recordings of the same song rarely start on the same sample, so
// a probe's frame grid sits at a fractional hop offset from the reference's;
// with a quarter-window hop those frames straddle different audio and the
// match degrades badly even for an identical excerpt. An eighth-hop at this
// rate puts a reference frame within 8ms of every probe frame, and costs
// less than the coarse version did at full rate.
