// (so a large write janks the frame it happens on), string-only, and capped
// around 5MB, which is a handful of songs.
//
// This is the local half of what a shared database would do. The lookup path
// -- fingerprint the audio, ask for a bundle, fall back to analysing -- is
// identical whether the answer comes from this store or one day from a
// server, so the seam is already in the right place.
//
// Eviction is least-recently-USED, not least-recently-added: the songs a
// person replays are the ones worth keeping, and insertion order says nothing
