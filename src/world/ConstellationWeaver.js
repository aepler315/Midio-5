// yMax used to stop at 0.58 -- barely past mid-screen -- and was widened to
// 0.95 on the theory that terrain, drawn after this layer, would occlude
// anything that dipped low. That reasoning doesn't hold for this game's
// actual look: ground-level landmarks (paintLatticeTower and friends,
// Landmarks.js) are drawn as bright STROKED wireframes, not filled
// silhouettes, so they never occlude anything behind them either -- and
// Midio's own groundY sits at 0.75 of the nominal stage, so 0.95 let dots
// land BELOW the ground line outright. The visible result: a figure's own
// lowest dot routinely plants itself right at the grass horizon, and since
// up to 3 figures can be alive at once (MAX_ACTIVE_FIGURES) for ~8 seconds
// each (HOLD_MS + FADE_MS), two of them doing that near the same moment reads
// as exactly the "stars bunched together" complaint this was meant to fix --
// now bunched by both resting on the same ground line instead of by X
// position. That regression got pulled back to 0.58, which killed the ground
// glitch but overcorrected: instrumenting a live 3-minute session (dumping
// every figure's and every crystallized star's own y-fraction) showed 100%
// of ~1600 dots landing between 0.05 and 0.575 -- literally zero dots ever
// below 58% of the frame, for the entire song, every time, by construction.
// Meanwhile actual terrain only peaks around 0.55 in valleys well below
// that; most of the screen's real open sky (roughly 0.58 up to the 0.75
// ground line) was sitting permanently empty. That's a second, independent
// mechanism for the exact same "everything's bunched in the middle"
// complaint: not a positional RNG bug, but every bright figure and star
// being structurally barred from most of the lower sky. Fixed properly this
// time by decoupling "how far down dots may be placed" from "how far down
// they render at full brightness": groundFadeAlpha (below) now fades
// exactly to 0 by yMax instead of flooring at a still-visible 0.15, so
// raising yMax back up to actually use the open sky can never reproduce the
// original grass-line glitch -- anything that drifts toward the new lower
// boundary just fades out first.
// yMax used to be a flat 0.70, tuned against ground-level terrain (Midio's
// own groundY sits at ~0.75, so 0.70 was "just above the grass"). That
// reasoning misses the far ocean (Ocean.js), which sits at the same depth
// as the ranges and starts at OCEAN_HORIZON_FRAC (~0.38) -- well above
// where terrain peaks. Terrain drawn after this layer occludes what it
// occludes, but water occludes nothing: a dot placed between the horizon
// and the ground line sat visibly IN the ocean in any gap between
// mountains, reading as a constellation sticking out of the sea. Sky ends
// at the horizon; nothing here should ever be placed below it.
