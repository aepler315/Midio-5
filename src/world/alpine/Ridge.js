// The Range's musical envelope.
//
// The mountains already dance, grow with the song, and change scale with
// each section. What they didn't have is the shared language the other
// painterly worlds use: a kick is not a new massif, bass is weight, and a
// decorative cut is not a new range.
//
// Ambient travel of the ridge is an inverted-U on the 1.2s energy average
// -- quiet songs keep a slow atmosphere, a groove breathes, dense material
// settles so the skyline does not strobe. Large terrain movement is saved
// for phrase boundaries that earned a lift (the same gate After Hours uses
// for blooms). Bass, the same 1.2s low-band average, swells the flanks.
// Isolated accents sharpen a summit on a quiet song; dense material raises
// the floor so only stronger hits mark the skyline.
//
// Pure and causal. Groove held in a one-pole would survive a backward seek.
