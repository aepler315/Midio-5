// Redline's musical envelope.
//
// The highway has to read as speed without inventing a beat from BPM -- the
// conductor already told us when a hit landed, and inventing a pulse for
// unmetered material is the same lie WorldMusic refuses. So travel rate
// comes from the 1.2s energy average, not from a tempo guess:
//
//   quiet  → a controlled crawl (the road still exists)
//   groove → a full cruise
//   dense  → half-time, so 170 BPM of drums does not strobe the grid
//
// Phrase boundaries that earned a lift (same gate After Hours uses for
// blooms) spend that lift on a tunnel-then-horizon passage: the mouth
// closes first, then the horizon opens. Decorative pacing cuts get
// nothing. Signage is occupancy, not traffic: one gantry catches the
// latest accent, the rest stay dim, density never spawns more signs.
//
// Everything is pure and causal. A rate held in a field would make a
// backward seek keep the previous song-position's speed.
