// The shape language of southern Utah.
//
// An alpine flank is one continuous curve from summit to foot -- a
// superellipse quarter, which is what RidgeShape.flankProfile draws. That is
// the right primitive for a mountain built by uplift and carved by ice. It is
// the wrong one for the Colorado Plateau, where the rock is flat-lying
// sedimentary layers of alternating hardness and erosion works on them
// LAYER BY LAYER rather than sculpting a continuous slope.
//
// The first version of this file drew that insight and then stopped there:
// six formations that were all the same skeleton -- caprock, cliff/bench
// stack, talus -- differing only in their fractions. On screen that reads as
// a row of trapezoids, because that is what it is. Southern Utah is not one
// idea. It is Monument Valley AND Bryce's hoodoo forests AND the Waterpocket
// Fold AND Arches' fins AND the Henry Mountains, which are eleven-thousand-
// foot laccoliths and look nothing like a butte at all.
//
// So the vocabulary here is six SKELETONS, each a different function of
// distance, not one skeleton with six parameter sets:
//
//   STACK    caprock over cliff-and-bench storeys over talus. The butte
//            family: Monument Valley, the Grand Staircase, mesas.
//   CUESTA   the same storeys, but wildly asymmetric -- one plumb face and
//            one long dip slope. Comb Ridge, the Waterpocket Fold.
//   DOME     rounded all the way, no flat top anywhere. Navajo sandstone:
//            Capitol Dome, the petrified dunes.
//   CONE     an actual mountain -- rounded summit, steep flanks, a flaring
//            concave base. The Henry Mountains, the La Sals, the Abajos are
//            laccoliths and they are the tallest thing in the region.
//   BADLAND  a soft rilled cone with no cap at all. Factory Butte, the
//            bentonite hills of Cathedral Valley.
//   TOWER    a narrow column: small cap, a capstone step, then wall. Bryce's
//            hoodoos, the Needles, Fisher Towers, the fins at Arches.
//
// Three levers carry the variety, and the last two matter as much as the
// profile: WIDTH (a fin is a fifth the width of a mesa), HEIGHT, and
// ASYMMETRY (a cuesta's dip slope runs several times longer than its face). A
// shape language with one width and one height is still a row of trapezoids
// however many profiles it has.
//
// The width range is deliberately not as wide as the real geology. A true
// fin is a hundred times longer than it is thick, and drawn honestly at this
// scale it comes out a single pixel across -- which reads as a render
// artifact, an antenna, anything but rock. The towers are therefore drawn
// stockier than they are, and the ratio to a mesa is held around four rather
// than ten. This is the one place the vocabulary knowingly lies, because the
// alternative does not read as the thing it accurately describes.
//
// Pure geometry, no canvas. SilhouetteGenerator composes these the same way
// it composed the alpine flanks.
