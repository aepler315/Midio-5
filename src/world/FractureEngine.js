// bottom-to-top and birth in that order as the song's stress accumulates,
// the thing genuinely RISES over the length of the track rather than merely
// fading up in place. The whole point is a scale reveal, not a portrait: a
// player should never be sure they're looking at an actual ship, only that
// whatever it is, it's ABOUT that size -- so the moment it turns out to be
// vastly bigger lands as a surprise instead of confirming a drawing.
//
//   1. A small, rough, barely-there mark breaks the water -- roughly
//      ship-sized, ambiguous in shape. Not a technical hull/deck/mast
//      illustration; just something small out there.
//   2. It keeps going down, and keeps going UP, wider each course. It was
//      never boat-sized; that was the exposed tip of something with no
//      visible bottom, and it swells far past its first impression as it climbs.
//   3. The shaft climbs, course by course, out of the ocean and through the
//      whole sky, widening well past anything a ship could be before it
//      finally narrows to a spire.
//   4. It crosses the deep-sky altitude where the SpaceRidge hangs -- and
//      the last birth of the song is the tie line that joins them.
//
// Every altitude here is derived from the constants that actually define the
// world's vertical extremes -- the ocean plane (Ocean.js) and the space
// ridge's own baseline (SpaceRidge.js) -- so the structure genuinely spans
// "ocean to outer space" and genuinely meets the ridge, instead of
// approximating both with magic numbers that would drift out of sync the
// moment either system was retuned.

// How far down the ocean plane (0 = far horizon, 1 = near edge) it stands.
// Sits well out on the plane rather than right at the horizon line: anchored
// up at the horizon the whole structure crams into the top quarter of the
// frame and reads as a stubby lump, which is the opposite of the point. Out
