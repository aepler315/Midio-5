// so recurrences can wear the same face: every chorus the same world/color,
// every verse another.
//
// The feature that says "same music" is a section's mean 7-band spectral
// SHAPE (its timbral fingerprint -- bass-heavy drop vs airy breakdown vs
// mid-forward verse), compared by cosine similarity so loudness alone
// doesn't decide identity, gated by a coarse energy-proximity check so two
// differently-voiced sections that happen to sit at the same loudness don't
// merge. Pure/DOM-free, like the other analysis modules (Dramaturgy,
// PhraseTracker, MountainChoreo).
