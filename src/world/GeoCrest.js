 * danceOffset(right boundary), and everything between is the straight line
 * joining them. So the silhouette's offset is a piecewise-linear
 * interpolation of danceOffset sampled on the column-boundary grid, and this
 * function is that same interpolation -- not an approximation of it.
 *
 * It replaces a cosine blend between column CENTERS, which was wrong twice
 * over. The blit sampled each column's LEFT EDGE and held it constant across
 * the column, so the stroke was a ramp phase-shifted half a column from a
 * staircase: the two only touched by accident, and everywhere else the neon
 * crest line floated off the fill it was supposed to be tracing. That is the
 * "ridges not lining up with themselves" artifact.

 * (PerfGovernor.danceColumnWidth), and must divide the strip width evenly --
 * see DANCE_COL_W's note on why.

 * edge between the boundary values, and nothing else is reachable. Overlays
 * that traced danceScaleSmooth's mid-column extremum instead were drawing a

 * ABOVE THE FOOT, the gap was zero at the foot and widest at the summits, and
 * it grew with the kick: 0.4px at rest, 4.3px on a kick, quantized to the
