// What a world is allowed to be, stated in one place.
//
// BiomeManager.draw() used to dispatch on `world.kind` through seven
// consecutive `if (kind === 'x') { drawXWorld(...); return; }` blocks, each
// handing the whole manager plus twelve or thirteen positional arguments to
// a module that then reached back into 19-36 of the manager's members. Two
// costs came out of that shape:
//
//   1. The argument lists drifted. Five worlds take `skyVoyage` and two do
//      not, so the same call spelled the same way meant different things
//      depending on which branch it sat in, and JavaScript drops a surplus
//      argument without a word. A `frame` object makes the mismatch a
//      property that is either there or not, rather than a position.
//   2. There was no answer to "what may a world touch?". The manager exposes
//      256 fields and 100 methods; the worlds use 40 of them. Nothing said
//      which 40, so every new world re-derived the answer by reading its
//      neighbours, and every new manager field looked equally fair game.
//
// WORLD_CONTRACT is that missing answer, and worldContract.test.js holds the
// line: a world module reaching for anything outside this list fails the
// build. The list is deliberately an allowlist and not a facade object --
// wrapping 40 members per frame would cost real time in the hot path to
// enforce statically what a test can enforce for free.
