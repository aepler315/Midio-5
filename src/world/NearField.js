// Near-field foreground occluders: the one classic side-scroller depth cue
// this game didn't have -- something large sweeping past IN FRONT of the
// characters. L7 (the old drawForeground) was three blurred white ellipses
// standing in for a whole parallax layer; everything else (L2-L5) got a
// real generated silhouette with biome-specific landmarks (Landmarks.js).
// This gives the frontmost layer the same treatment, reusing those exact
// landmark painters -- just huge, near-black, and drawn directly at a
// faster-than-character scroll ratio instead of baked into a tileable
// strip, since these have to occlude Midio as they cross him.
//
// Placement follows FarVignettes.js's architecture exactly: a seeded sector
// grid of SCROLLED space, so the same file always hides the same shapes in
// the same places (a replay can be pointed at: "the crystal spire is right
// after the second chorus"). Unlike FarVignettes, a sector's SHAPE also
// depends on which biome is showing when the sector first comes into view
// -- captured once and cached forever, so a later biome change never
// retroactively reskins something already placed.
