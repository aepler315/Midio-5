// A real spectral sea, layered under the existing ocean contour rows
// (Ocean.js's seaLineY et al, which stay exactly as they were -- this is
// an ADDITIVE depth pass, not a replacement). Pure math, no canvas: a sum
// of sinusoidal components sampled from a Pierson-Moskowitz-shaped energy
// spectrum, each obeying the deep-water dispersion relation (omega^2 = g*k,
// so longer waves genuinely travel faster and outrun shorter ones), combined
// with Gerstner horizontal displacement so crests sharpen and troughs
// flatten the way real swell does instead of a symmetric sine.
//
// The brief this answers: "give it a complex wave physics system... but
// isn't flashy... we don't want the ocean to say 'holy shit look at me'."
// So the amplitudes here are deliberately modest next to Ocean.js's own
// hand-tuned rows -- this is the layer that rewards someone who stops and
// stares (swell trains passing through each other, dispersion, crest
// sharpening under wind), not something that announces itself. Music never
// drives a wave directly; it only ever shifts the WEATHER (wind speed) that
// the spectrum is sampled from, eased over several seconds so a single loud
// beat can never visibly "make a wave."
