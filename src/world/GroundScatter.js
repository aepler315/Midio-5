// Ground scatter: the frontmost plane's small detail -- the layer of loose
// surface material (pebbles, shards, tufts, splinters) rushing past right
// under the camera.
//
// Why this layer exists: measured against a live frame, the ground band
// carried roughly a third the local contrast of the sky and mountain bands
// (~1.7 vs ~5.0 and ~4.3). That is depth cueing running backwards -- the
// NEAREST plane had the LEAST texture, so the surface Midio actually runs
// along read as a flat slab while everything behind it was dense with
// detail. drawForeground held only three soft veil ellipses and NearField's
// big landmark occluders (roughly one per 2000px of scrolled space), so
// there was no small-scale frontmost detail at all, and nothing anywhere in
// the frame that conveyed ground speed.
//
// Two things follow from "closer than everything else":
//
//   • It scrolls FASTEST (SCATTER_RATIO, above NearField's 1.42 and the
//     characters' 1.00). That difference is the entire speed cue.
//   • It sits LOWER in frame than the terrain surface. Ground nearer the
//     camera projects further down, so these ride their own baseline below
//     groundY rather than being glued to the terrain contour -- which is
//     also what keeps them off the play line entirely: they are scenery
//     under Midio's feet, never obstacles in front of him.
//
// Geometry here is pure and seeded (tests exercise it directly); GroundScatter
// only turns it into strokes.
