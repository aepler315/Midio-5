//   rawness    percussive onsets and grit    <-> unweathered, irregular skyline

// scores 0.98 and nothing else comes close, so any big dynamic arc landed
// there. So the ranges are compared by RANK on each axis -- a range's score
// is where it stands in its basket, 0 lowest to 1 highest -- and the song is
// placed by PERCENTILE, against how real songs spread on each axis, so both
// sides fill the same space evenly.
//
// Then a lottery, not a nearest-wins. Every range keeps FAIR_SHARE of an
// equal share of every song's draw; the rest goes to the ranges nearest the
// song's character. So each range gets a roughly equal chance across many
// songs, a song still leans toward ranges like it, and one song always draws
// the same range (the seed is the ticket). Ranges this player saw recently
// sit the draw out while anything else is left.
//
// Three ridges, three ranges. The back ridge is a high range, the middle a
// mid one and the front a low one, by relief -- how far the skyline rises
// above its own floor. Each band runs its own draw (matchRidgeSet).
