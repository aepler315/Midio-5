// The dancing ridge on the horizon, shaped like a real one.
//
// The horizon EQ (BiomeManager._drawHorizonEQ) is a luminous ridge whose
// height is the live 7-band spectrum. On its own that spectrum is a smooth
// hump with no geography in it. Here it gets a real crest to stand on: one
// of a short list of famous skylines in the lower 48 and southern British
// Columbia and Alberta (HORIZON_RANGES), taken from the same scanned
// profiles the parallax ridges draw.
//
// The crest is the ridge's resting shape; the music scales it. Height at
// any point is crest x (rest + (1 - rest) x band level), anchored at the
// foot, so a loud band lifts that stretch of the real ridge and a quiet one
// lowers it, and the outline -- the Grand Teton's spire, Rainier's dome --
// never stops reading as itself. Scaling a smooth crest by a smooth,
// time-smoothed band level keeps a steep face smooth as it drops: every
// point on the face moves in proportion, so the face shortens rather than
// breaking up.
//
// Across the song the view slides along the range, from one side of the
// summit to the other, so the summit is on screen for most of it. Pure
// math, no canvas: BiomeManager draws it, tests exercise it directly.
