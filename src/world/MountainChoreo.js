 *  violent motion was the thing sitting closest to the camera, right behind
 *  the characters, so the foreground flapped while the horizon sat still.
 *  Reversed, the same choreography reads as intended: a huge slow skyline
 *  heaving away in the distance, the ground underfoot comparatively steady,
 *  and the kick wave rolling FORWARD out of the back of the scene.
 *
 *  waveLen/waveHz/phase stay as they were and are deliberately co-prime-ish

// hard doesn't read as a mountain range breathing; it reads as the back
// ridge vibrating, because parallax has already told the eye it should be
// nearly still. Near ranges may move; distant ones may only barely.
