// Finding out whether the file chooser actually exists, and stopping the
// page from lying about it.
//
// THE SYMPTOM. In Fermata's built-in browser, tapping "Browse files" opens
// the Android soft keyboard instead of a file chooser. Nothing is being
// typed and no chooser ever appears.
//
// THE CAUSE. A WebView has no chooser of its own; it asks the host app via
// `WebChromeClient.onShowFileChooser()`. An app that does not override that
// method gets no chooser, and the click leaves the (visually hidden) input
// as the focused element -- so Android raises the IME for it. The keyboard
// is not the bug, it is the residue of a click that went nowhere.
//
// WHY THIS CANNOT BE FEATURE-DETECTED. There is no API that reports whether
// a chooser will appear. `HTMLInputElement` exists, `type="file"` is
// supported, `.click()` resolves without throwing, and no event fires on
// failure -- from script, a WebView with no chooser is indistinguishable
// from a player who opened a chooser and is still looking through it.
//
// So it is detected by consequence instead. Opening a real chooser is a
// separate activity or window: the page loses focus, or is hidden, or gets
// a `change`/`cancel` event when the player is done. A WebView with no
// chooser produces none of those -- it just quietly focuses the input. So:
// click, then wait. If nothing observable happened within the grace period
// AND the file input is still the focused element, no chooser opened.
//
// That last clause carries the weight. A slow chooser and a missing chooser
// both produce silence; only the missing one leaves *our* input focused,
// because a real chooser takes focus away from the document entirely.
//
// The verdict is remembered, so a player pays the wait once per browser and
// every later tap goes straight to the alternatives.
