// Car mode: keeping a head-unit display awake during a song.
//
// The problem this solves (an Auto Pro X / Android Auto dongle projecting
// this page onto a car receiver): with no touch input the display blanks
// after a minute, and the tap that brings it back also lands on the page --
// on a button, or on Chrome's own fullscreen furniture -- so the show drops
// out of fullscreen just to be woken up.
//
// What this module does NOT do, because no web page can: synthesize a tap.
// A JS-dispatched PointerEvent is untrusted; it never leaves the browser's
// event loop, so it cannot reach the Android input stack or the receiver's
// own idle timer. Anything a page fakes is invisible to the thing counting
// the idle seconds. The two levers that do exist are both used here:
//
//   1. Screen Wake Lock (navigator.wakeLock) -- the sanctioned way to tell
//      the OS "do not blank the display". Supported by Chrome on Android,
//      which is what these dongles run. Held while a song is playing and
//      re-armed on a heartbeat, because the lock is dropped for us whenever
//      the page is backgrounded, the tab is hidden, or the system takes it.
//   2. A hidden looping video as a fallback for the (older) WebViews with no
//      wakeLock at all, where playing video is the only thing that still
//      counts as "in use". Best effort, and silent when it isn't honored.
//
// The residual case -- the display blanked anyway and the player taps to
// bring it back -- is handled by the caller (main.js), which spends that
// first tap entirely on restoring fullscreen rather than letting it reach
// the UI. Same "tap to unlock" beat the HUD auto-fade already uses.
