// Perf-degradation ladder (spec §6.2): "under load it sheds in order: vision
// loop -> particle caps -> crack refraction -> L7 foreground veil -> biome
// crossfade quality." Sheds one rung after a sustained run of over-budget
// frames, recovers one rung after a sustained clean window — hysteresis so
// the ladder doesn't chatter around the budget line.
//
// This codebase never built the profile-blend memoization the spec's fifth
// rung ("crossfade quality 128->32 steps") would cheapen, and per-pixel
// crack refraction was likewise never implemented (§4.2.2 already marks it
// desktop-only/optional). Rather than gate fictional features, "crack
// refraction" here sheds the crack glow-tint stroke pass (the nearest real
// cost in that same draw call), and the crossfade-quality rung is folded
// into the particle rung it would otherwise duplicate.
//
// Mobile performance round: the ladder used to be reactive-only (shed after
// ~1s of visible jank, same speed regardless of how far over budget a frame
// ran) and shallow (its four rungs never touched the optional phenomena
// systems or the overlay-pass stack, the actual bulk of the frame on a
// weak GPU). Two extensions:
//  - `sample()` now weighs each over-budget frame by how far over it ran,
//    so a badly blown frame (2-3x budget) sheds a rung in a few frames
//    instead of ~60 — a barely-over-budget frame still takes ~1s, same as
//    before.
//  - Two deeper rungs (5-6) gate the optional phenomena layer and the
//    overlay-pass stack, so a device that's still over budget after the
//    original four rungs degrades to a clean core instead of stuttering.

// What sample() actually receives is the raw rAF-to-rAF delta: the frame
// PERIOD, vsync wait included -- not the time spent working inside it. So
// this threshold has to be a frame-period threshold, and the old value (15,
// described in its own comment as "16.6ms frame budget, ~15ms of it") was a
// WORK budget being compared against a period. On any 60Hz display that made
// every healthy frame ~16.67ms "over budget" and no frame ever clean: the
// accumulator reached 60 in about 54 frames, shed a rung, reset, and did it
// again -- MAX_LEVEL in roughly five seconds, on hardware that was keeping up
// perfectly, with recovery impossible because a clean frame could never
// occur. Everything gated on the deeper rungs (phenomena, the heavy overlay
// passes, the terrain's own detail) switched itself off a few seconds into
// every song on every machine.
//
// 18.5ms sits clear of a 60Hz period (16.67) plus its ordinary vsync jitter,
// and below the 20ms one bad frame is elsewhere taken to mean. Crossing it
// means the frame period slipped past ~54fps, which is a real dropped frame.
// A 120Hz display (8.3ms) is comfortably clean; a 30fps scene (33ms) still
// sheds, as it should.

// the case that needs it most. A frame at 1fps is ~54x over budget and still
// counted as 6, so shedding one rung took ten such frames -- ten seconds of
// unusable output -- and reaching a rung six deep would have taken a minute.
// Once the machine has produced a short run of catastrophic frames it has

// briefly busy and wrong for one that genuinely cannot afford the rung
// below -- there, the ladder becomes an OSCILLATOR. It sheds down to
// something playable, banks ten clean seconds, climbs back into the rung
// that was drowning it, collapses, and spends however long it takes to shed
// again. At 4K that round trip measured ~10s of 60fps followed by ~10s at
// about 1fps, on repeat: "it'll be 60fps for a few seconds then drop to 1 or
// 2fps for a few seconds", which is the report this exists to answer.
//
// So each rung remembers how often the machine has fallen back out of it
// AFTER HAVING RECOVERED INTO IT, and the clean window required to try it
// again doubles per fall. The qualifier is the whole precision of this: the
// first descent through a rung is not evidence of anything -- it is a cold
// machine, or a load hitch, or another program taking the CPU for a second
// -- and penalising it would slow every ordinary recovery down for nothing.
// Coming back OUT of a rung the ladder had already climbed back into is the
