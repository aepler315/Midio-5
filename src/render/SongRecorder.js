// Recording a performance to a file, live, in the page.
//
// Two streams, one clock. The video track is a canvas this class composites
// every rendered frame into; the audio track is tapped off the audio
// engine's master bus. MediaRecorder timestamps both from the same source,
// which is the entire reason a recording stays in sync when a mirrored or
// projected screen does not: there, the audio and the picture reach the
// player by different paths with independent latency, and a show
// choreographed to the beat drifts off it.
//
// ## Why composite instead of capturing the stage directly
//
// `stage.captureStream()` would be less code and is wrong here. The stage's
// backing store is not a fixed size: the resolution selector offers 320x180
// through 4K, and the Auto setting lets the perf governor CHANGE it mid-song
// under frame pressure. A video track whose dimensions change halfway
// through is not something an encoder or a player handles gracefully.
// Compositing into a canvas of the export's own size makes the recording
// independent of all of that, and gives the letterboxing somewhere to
// happen for targets that are not 16:9.
//
// ## Why frames are pushed rather than sampled
//
// `captureStream(fps)` lets the browser sample the canvas on its own clock,
// which duplicates frames when it samples faster than the app draws and
// drops them when it samples slower. `captureStream(0)` plus an explicit
// `requestFrame()` after each composite yields exactly one encoded frame per
// rendered frame. Where `requestFrame` is missing, it falls back to timed
// sampling rather than refusing to record.
