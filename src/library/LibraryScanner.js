// and decoding even one of them costs more than reading the tags of all of
// them -- durations arrive later, one per song, as each is actually played.
//

// (`dirHandle.values()` yielding `{kind, name}`, files via `getFile()`)
// rather than the real thing, so the walk is testable against a plain object
// tree with no browser in sight.
