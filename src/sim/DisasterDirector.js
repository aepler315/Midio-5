// The arbiter for large-scale hazard events: earthquake (pre-scheduled,
// anchored to a song hotspot) and wildfire (threshold-triggered, gated on
// WeatherDirector.dryness01 rather than a fixed time -- a fire needs the
// world to actually be dry, which is a live weather-history quantity, not
// something knowable in advance at construction time). Flood registers
// here too, but purely reactively (see FloodDirector.armFromTsunami) --
// it never competes for this arbiter's exclusivity lock since it's a
// consequence layer, not a standalone spectacle.
//
// Owns exclusivity (only one disaster live at a time), a cooldown floor,
// and -- for the pre-scheduled kinds -- anchoring to the song's own energy
// hotspots, the same technique OceanLife.tsunamiSchedule and
// OrogenyDirector.findClimaxMs already use, so a disaster reads as a
// musical event rather than a wall-clock timer.
//
// Pure scheduling lives in buildDisasterSchedule (directly testable); the
// class just walks that schedule forward and fires the matching director's
// strike(), plus the separate threshold check for fire. Each kind's own
// director (QuakeDirector, FireDirector) owns its actual envelope/
// rendering -- this file only decides WHEN and IF one may start.
